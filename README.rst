Why?
====
There is no established Polls plugin for DjangoCMS. Yes, `cmsplugin-poll <https://bitbucket.org/tonioo/cmsplugin-poll>`_ exists, 
but it's latest update was at 2013 and looks like it is abandoned. Personaly I want a simple plugin, that is up to date and support
latest Django and DjangoCMS. So this one could be at the spot.

Requirements
============

It works fine and tested under ``Python 2.7``. The following libraries are required

- ``Django`` >= 1.5
- ``django-cms`` >= 3.0 (we recommend to use Django CMS 3.0 and higher, contact us if you need prior CMS versions supports and have some issues)

Contributing
============
Fork the repo, create a feature branch then send me pull request. Feel free to create new issues or contact me via email.
